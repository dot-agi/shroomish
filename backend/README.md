# Oddish Backend

Serverless API and worker orchestration for Oddish Cloud, deployed on [Modal](https://modal.com), with multi-tenant authentication and authorization.

## Overview

The backend wraps the OSS `oddish` core with:
- Multi-tenant API (`org_id`-scoped queries)
- Dual auth (API keys + Clerk JWTs)
- Modal-hosted API/workers/sandboxes, or Railway/Docker for standalone deployment
- Queue-key concurrency controls
- Public token-based sharing endpoints

## System Architecture

### Data flow

```
User (Dashboard, CLI, SDK)
  │
  ▼
Modal API (FastAPI in `endpoints.py` and `api/routers/*`)
  │  - Auth: API key or Clerk JWT
  │  - Writes task/trial state in Postgres
  ▼
Postgres (oddish + cloud tables)
  │
  ▼
Worker dispatcher (`worker/functions.py`, every 120s)
  │  - Spawns single-job workers by queue key
  ▼
Single-job workers (process one job, then exit)
  │
  ▼
Modal sandboxes (Harbor execution, logs/artifacts to S3 or volume)
```

### Worker architecture

Dispatcher + single-job pattern:
1. `poll_queue()` runs on a 120s Modal schedule, clears stale queue state, and launches up to `MAX_WORKERS_PER_POLL` single-job workers based on queue depth and concurrency limits.
2. `process_single_job(queue_key)` acquires a queue-slot lease, processes one `trial`/`analysis`/`verdict`, emits updates, and exits.

This keeps concurrency deterministic and avoids long-lived worker drift.

## Authentication Model

The backend accepts auth from `Authorization`, `X-Clerk-Authorization`, or `X-Authorization`.

### API keys (programmatic access)

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ok_abc123..." "$API_URL/tasks"
```

- Key format starts with `ok_`
- Stored hashed (SHA-256) in `api_keys`
- Scope options: `full`, `tasks`, `read`

### Clerk JWTs (dashboard access)

- Validated against Clerk JWKS
- Organization context extracted from token claims
- User and org membership resolved to internal auth context

### Auth flow

1. Read token from accepted header.
2. If token starts with `ok_`, validate API key and scope.
3. Otherwise validate Clerk JWT and resolve org/user.
4. Return auth context (`org_id`, `user_id`, `scope`) to route handlers.

If a Clerk JWT arrives without an `org_id`, the backend will try to resolve a
single existing org membership and, if none exists, provision a personal org for
that user.

## Multi-tenancy

All task/trial/experiment access is org-scoped. Cloud-side schema adds:

- `experiments.org_id`
- `tasks.org_id`, `tasks.created_by_user_id`, `tasks.task_s3_key`
- `trials.org_id`, `trials.trial_s3_key`

The API layer enforces this scope in all list/read/write queries.

## Configuration

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Use `backend/.env.example` as the starting point for local backend config.
For the API and worker runtime, the minimum required values are:

- `ODDISH_DATABASE_URL`
- `CLERK_DOMAIN`

Required for Clerk-backed org invites, membership lookups, and GitHub username enrichment:

- `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`

Required if you want Clerk webhook ingestion enabled:

- `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

Common optional settings:

- `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`
- `CLERK_ISSUER`
- `CLERK_JWT_AUDIENCE`
- `ODDISH_S3_*`
- provider keys such as `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `DAYTONA_API_KEY`
- GitHub notifier settings such as `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `ODDISH_DASHBOARD_URL`

Modal runtime knobs are read directly by `modal_app.py`, including:

- `ODDISH_ENABLE_MODAL_WORKERS`
- `ODDISH_MODAL_API_MIN_CONTAINERS`
- `ODDISH_MODAL_API_BUFFER_CONTAINERS`
- `ODDISH_MODAL_API_MAX_CONTAINERS`
- `ODDISH_MODAL_API_CONCURRENCY_TARGET`
- `ODDISH_MODAL_API_CONCURRENCY_MAX`
- `ODDISH_MODAL_WORKER_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`
- `ODDISH_MODAL_WORKER_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`
- `ODDISH_MODAL_WORKER_MIN_CONTAINERS`
- `ODDISH_MODAL_WORKER_BUFFER_CONTAINERS`
- `ODDISH_MODAL_WORKER_SCALEDOWN_WINDOW_SECONDS`
- `ODDISH_MODAL_WORKER_MAX_CONTAINERS`
- `ODDISH_MODAL_MAX_WORKERS_PER_POLL`
- `ODDISH_MODEL_CONCURRENCY_DEFAULT`
- `MODAL_APP_NAME`
- `MODAL_VOLUME_NAME`
- `MODAL_SECRET_ENVIRONMENT`

Local `backend/.env` values are layered on top of the shared Modal secret for local deploys.

### oddish runtime patching

`endpoints.py`, `serve.py`, and `worker/runtime.py` patch oddish settings at startup:

- `endpoints.py` / `serve.py`: set `db_use_null_pool` for per-request DB connections
- `worker/runtime.py`: disable auto-started local workers, point storage paths to mounted Modal volumes, and force Harbor environment to Modal-compatible mode

## API Endpoints

All routes require auth unless marked public.

## Database and Migrations

Two migration stacks are required on fresh environments:
1. Core tables: `oddish/alembic/`
2. Cloud tables/extensions: `backend/alembic/`

```bash
# Core (run in oddish/)
uv run alembic upgrade head

# Cloud (run in backend/)
uv run alembic upgrade head
```

## Development Workflows

```bash
# Install backend deps (includes the local ../oddish path dependency)
cd backend
uv sync
```

```bash
# Backend only (Modal local serve)
cd backend
uv run modal serve deploy.py
```

For full-stack local development, use one of these flows:

```bash
# Flow A: Frontend + local core API
# Terminal 1 — start Postgres, then the API
docker run -d --name oddish-db -e POSTGRES_USER=oddish -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=oddish -e POSTGRES_DB=oddish -p 5432:5432 postgres:16-alpine
cd oddish
uv run python -m oddish.db setup
uv run python -m oddish.api

# Terminal 2
cd frontend
pnpm dev:local
```

```bash
# Flow B: Frontend + Modal backend
# Terminal 1
cd backend
uv run modal serve deploy.py

# Terminal 2
cd frontend
pnpm dev:modal
```

### Smoke tests

```bash
# authenticated list
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $ODDISH_API_KEY" "$ODDISH_MODAL_API_URL/tasks" | jq

# dashboard queue overview
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $ODDISH_API_KEY" "$ODDISH_MODAL_API_URL/dashboard" | jq '.queues'
```
